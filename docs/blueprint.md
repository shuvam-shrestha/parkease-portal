## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(50, 80%, 50%) translates to a golden yellow (#D4A317) to evoke a sense of efficiency and security.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated yellow at HSL(50, 20%, 95%) represented by the hex code (#F9F6EF), which offers a soft, unobtrusive backdrop that allows the golden primary to take center stage.
- Accent color: Analogous to the golden primary, use HSL(20, 80%, 40%) for an orange-toned accent color, or approximately (#B84F0A), for highlighting CTAs and interactive elements without overshadowing the primary tone.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, neutral, and readable interface.
- Use minimalist, easily recognizable icons representing parking functions (check-in, check-out, editing) and amenities.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for parking details, updates, and action items for a dashboard-like experience.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to provide feedback and maintain user engagement.
